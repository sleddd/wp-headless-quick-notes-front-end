# Quick Notes 
by Claudette M Raynor - Currently a work in progress

Quick notes is a simple note taking app built using WordPress, React, and GraphQL.

----
It originally started as a typescript experiment (general excuse to practice typescript while learning) and has evolved over time into a sandbox app to test out headless WordPress.

Front end app: https://github.com/sleddd/wp-headless-quick-notes-front-end.git  \
Backend plugin: https://github.com/sleddd/wp-headless-quick-notes-back-end.git
